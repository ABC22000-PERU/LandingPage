## Features

Your project will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- 🎁 **Modern** – Template created using the latest features of React (State management using Hooks, Code-Splitting to reduce the bundle size)

- 💻 **Responsive** – Highly responsive and reusable UI components, that change depending on the provided props

- 🚀 **Fast** – Buttery smooth experience thanks to the implementation of best practices and no third party dependencies, resulting in <b>PERFECT</b> Google Lighthouse scores

- 🏷 **TypeScript support** – Landy is written in TypeScript to improve the DX

- 🌍 **Internationalization** - Prebuilt standalone file that works in every environment and doesn't require reloading the page to translate the content

- 🛸 **Routing** - Each file inside the src/pages directory will generate its own route, so you don't have to manually handle the routing

- 🤙 **Contact Form** - Contact form written in React Hooks, with uncontrolled form validation to reduce unnecessary performance penalty. You just need to provide the endpoint

- ⚙️ **Maintenance** - All of the content is stored in the JSON files, so that you can easily manage the content of the website
